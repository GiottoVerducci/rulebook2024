# V:TES Rulebook 2024

This repository is designed for players to log suggested rulebook changes (with reference to printed rulebook v1.1).

Each suggestion should be submitted as a "pull request" that the rulebook team (Gines, Hugh and Vincent) can review. The images are provided as a placeholder of the real images used and should not be modified.

The rulebook team intend to review suggestions on a quarterly basis but other items my take that time away.

Not all changes will be approved.

To learn about how to contribute, read the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) or watch this [explanatory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_FLqX3vGR4)
